📚 Library Management System - SQL Project

📝 Project Overview

The Library Management System is a structured database project designed to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve information about books, authors, borrowers, and transactions. The project demonstrates various SQL concepts, including database creation, data insertion, querying, constraints, joins, views, stored procedures, triggers, and normalization.

🔍 Features & Functionality

📌 Step 01: Basic Database Setup & Data Insertion

- Create a LibraryDB database.

- Define a Books table to store book details.

- Insert sample records of books with attributes such as title, author, genre, and year published.

📌 Step 02: Simple Queries & Data Retrieval

- Retrieve all books from the database.

- Filter books based on author and year of publication.

- Count the number of books in each genre.

📌 Step 03: Adding Constraints & Modifying Data

- Add constraints such as unique keys and NOT NULL constraints.

- Modify book genres and update book details.

- Implement delete functionality for removing book records.

📌 Step 04: Advanced Queries with Joins

- Create an Authors table to store author details.

- Establish a foreign key relationship between books and authors.

- Retrieve book details along with their respective authors using JOIN operations.

📌 Step 05: Data Integrity with Constraints & Foreign Keys

- Create a Borrowers table to store information about individuals who borrow books.

- Implement foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity.

- Track book borrowing activity and retrieve borrower details.

📌 Step 06: Subqueries & Aggregation

- Perform aggregation functions to analyze book data.

- Retrieve books with the highest publication year.

- Use subqueries to compare book publication years with the average.

📌 Step 07: Views & Data Manipulation

- Create a view to combine book, author, and borrower details.

- Retrieve and drop views as needed.

📌 Step 08: Stored Procedures & Triggers

- Implement stored procedures to automate book genre updates.

- Design triggers to update borrowing records automatically when new borrowers are added.

📌 Step 09: Normalization

- Demonstrate database normalization by structuring tables efficiently.

- Separate books, authors, publishers, and borrowers into independent tables.

- Establish foreign key relationships to ensure data consistency.

🚀 How to Use

- Clone the repository to your local system.

- Execute the SQL scripts step by step in a MySQL environment.

- Modify the queries as needed to test different use cases.
